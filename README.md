This is an attempt to create a compiler for a toy programming language.

This programming language is limited to;

- print strings.

print "Hello World"

- assigning variables

var a = 12

- performing basic arithmetic operations on variables and literals

var a = 1

var b = 2

var c = a + b

print c

This language is not Turing complete as it doesnt implement control flow at the moment.
